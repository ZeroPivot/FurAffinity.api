However, I have a generalized form of how to load [logged in] cookies from your browser using Mechanize

1. Login to Furaffinity.net
2. Save your cookie as cookies.txt using a cookies.txt Firefox addon: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/
3. It saves the page as index.html--if you see your username at the top, you have successfully used the cookie.
